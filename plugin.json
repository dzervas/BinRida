  "longdescription": "# Frinja\n\nAuthor: **Dimitris Zervas**\n\nFrida plugin for binary ninja.\n\nA set of jinja-enabled frida scripts using the context of binary ninja's static analysis.\n\nThis is a continuation of the [BinRida](https://github.com/c3r34lk1ll3r/BinRida) plugin by @[c3r34lk1ll3r](https://github.com/c3r34lk1ll3r).\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst of all you'll need to go to `Plugins > Frinja > Settings` to set up the frida\nconnection and the application to be instrumented.\n\nAfterwards you can use any available commands - the `Hook Function` and `Run Hooker`\ncommands are explained [below](#hooker)\n\n### Dump Function Context\n\nIt hooks and gathers all calls and returns of the focused function and generates\na markdown report with the following information:\n\n- Callee address\n- Thread ID\n- Arguments (tries to dereference pointers, read strings and numbers)\n- Return value\n- Register values\n\n### Inspect Function Paths\n\nA code coverage tracer for the focused function that highlights the executed basic blocks\n\n## Hooker\n\nThe main show of this plugin is the `Run Hooker` command. It allows you to trace\nand tamper with the execution of the application.\n\nAfter a function is marked with the `Hook Function` command (or any function with\nthe `Frinja Hooked` tag) all its calls and returns will get logged in the log pane.\n\nThere's also the ability to add pre and post hooks to the function as well as altering\nthe return value.\n\nTo do so a function comment should be added in the following format:\n\n```text\n@prehook: <prehook js code>\n@posthook: <posthook js code>\n@ret: <return value>\n```\n\nThe return value can be any kind of valid javascript expression\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under a MIT license.",
